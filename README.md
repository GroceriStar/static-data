## Synopsis

Recipe related static data, like ingredients, recipes, diets, allergies, etc.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

In a few our projects we have a similar files. And we always copy-paste code between them. So by moving this code into separated place - i hope we'll make our projects better.
